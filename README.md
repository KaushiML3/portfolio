### Computer vision 

#### cucumber leaf diseases classification

- Cucumber leaves are susceptible to various diseases, primarily fungal and bacterial. Common issues include powdery mildew, which forms white, powdery spots on leaves, and downy mildew, characterized by yellow patches and a fuzzy underside. Anthracnose causes dark, sunken spots on leaves and fruit, while angular leaf spot results in water-soaked lesions that become angular and brown.Bacterial wilt, spread by cucumber beetles, causes leaves to wilt and die. Proper spacing, crop rotation, and the use of resistant varieties can help manage these diseases, along with timely fungicide or bactericide applications.

              This repository implements an Image Multi-Label Classification model, which can identify multiple labels in a single image. Unlike traditional image                         classification, where an image is assigned a single category, multi-label classification allows an image to have multiple labels simultaneously.

#### Tranfer Learning - Vision Transformer: 

- Vision Transformers (ViTs) are a type of neural network architecture designed primarily for processing images. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which process images in a hierarchical manner, ViTs apply self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies between image patches. This allows them to achieve strong performance on various computer vision tasks without relying on convolutional layers. ViTs have gained popularity for their ability to handle long-range dependencies effectively, making them suitable for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation. The original Vision Transformer developed by Google. It divides images into patches, processes them as tokens, and applies transformer layers.This repository include how to fine tune the vision transformer model.
